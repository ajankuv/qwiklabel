#qwiklabel v1 for vipparcel
---

Uses datamade.us's usaddress lib to parse and format single line USA addresses into a printable label format for shipping.

My wife and I run a online store, and one of our good channels for sales is Mercari. She normally pastes me one line addresses from the app into skype. I have emailed them over and over to have some sort of web based backend for sellers/labels since one line addresses are horrid.




required pip installs = flask, usaddress, requests
